1) Copy the two files CIRRMS.sx and CIRRMS_C.c to the directory /usr/local/sde/kit.
   Also copy the file m82510.h from the directory above (..).

2) Edit the file /usr/local/sde/examples/make.inc, and add the following 
   three lines at the beginning:

SBD		=CIRRMS
RAMDOWNLOAD	=lsi
DLSYMS		=-y

3) Try building and downloading a few examples, e.g. ex1, ex2 and ex3.
   The makefiles will build ex?ram.lsi, which you can download to the board.
   See section 7 of the SDE manual and the PMON manual for mode info.

4) To create a new program (e.g. a diagnostic or benchmark).  
   a) Read the SDE manual!!  
   b) Create a new directory in /sde/examples (e.g. /sde/examples/diag).
   c) Copy the Makefile from a "similar" examples, e.g.
         ex1 - for really noddy programs
         ex2 - for programs which need to handle exceptions and/or interrupts
         ex5 - for integer benchmarks
	 ex6 - for floating point benchmarks
   d) Edit the makefile and put the name of your source file(s)
      after OBJS=  (changing .c to .o), e.g.
   	OBJS	=diag.o
   e) Change PROG= to the name of your program.
   f) Make it: you should get a downloadable file diagram.lsi which can be
      downloaded to the board, and diagrom.s3 which can be blown into ROM.

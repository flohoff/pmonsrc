This release is a snapshot of Algorithmics' port of LSI Logic's PMON
prom monitor.  It comes with a number of caveats:

1) It will currently build for Algorithmics P-4000i board (also
   available as the IDT 79S460), LSI's Pocket Rocket board and
   IDT's 79RS385 board.

   We intend to support a larger range of our own boards, and others,
   very shortly.

2) It is configured to be built by Algorithmics SDE-MIPS compiler, and
   GNU make.  We can make no guarantees about its use of any other
   tool-chain.  In particular the 64-bit R4000 support code requires
   SDE-MIPS version 2.0 (R3000 or 32-bit only versions should be
   buildable using the previous SDE-MIPS release 1.4).

Having installed this source tree in a directory of your choice, you
must set environment variable $LSIPKG to the full pathname of
the top of the source tree. E.g

	% setenv LSIPKG /homes/joe/pmonsrc

Then, to build for PMON for the P4032 board (for example)

	% sde-make PMONDIRS=P4032

There now follows a quick guided tour of the directory structure:

$LSIPKG/

	Typing "sde-make" in this top directory will build a version of
	PMON for the P4000i board (the list of boards is specified by
	the PMONDIRS variable in $LSIPKG/pmon/Makefile, the list of CPU
	types is in $LSIPKG/lib/Makefile).  This directory contains
	the following important files;

	Makefile - the top level makefile.

	defines.mk - specifies the compiler, assembler and associated flags.

	R4000.mk - defines CPU specific compilation options for R4000
	
	R3000.mk - defines CPU specific compilation options for R3000

	LR33K.mk - defines CPU specific compilation options for LR330x0


$LSIPKG/include

	Include files used by PMON and its associated library routines.

$LSIPKG/lib 
	
	All C library routines used by PMON, plus utilities like cache
	handling.  Originally this was supplied by LSI Logic in a form
	which could be used with other standalone programs: this is
	not used or supported by our build mechanism, and it used as
	part of PMON only.  
	
$LSIPKG/lib/R4000
	
	Directory in which R4000 version of the PMON C library is built.

$LSIPKG/lib/R3000
	
	Directory in which R3000 version of the PMON C library is built.

$LSIPKG/lib/LR33K
	
	Directory in which LR330x0 version of the PMON C library is built.

$LSIPKG/pmon

	The source code of the PMON monitor.

$LSIPKG/pmon/algcommon
	
	Platform-specific code common to all Algorithmics boards.

$LSIPKG/pmon/algvme

	Platform-specific code for Algorithmics VMEbus boards.
	(This needs further work before it will build).

$LSIPKG/pmon/p4000

	Platform-specific code for Algorithmics P4000 board.

$LSIPKG/pmon/p4032

	Platform-specific code for Algorithmics P4032 board.

$LSIPKG/pmon/p5064

	Platform-specific code for Algorithmics P5064 board.

$LSIPKG/pmon/lsipr

	Platform-specific code for LSI Logic's Pocket Rocket board.
	(This needs further work before it will build).

etc.

$LSIPKG/pmon/P4000

	Directory in which the final PMON executable (ready to
	download to PROM) for Algorithmics P4000 board is built.

$LSIPKG/pmon/VME4000

	Directory in which the final PMON executable for Algorithmics
	VME4000 board is built.

$LSIPKG/pmon/LSIPR

	Directory in which the final PMON executable for LSI Logic's
	Pocket Rocket board is built.

$LSIPKG/pmon/P4032

	Directory in which the final PMON executable for Algorithmics
	P4032 board is built.

$LSIPKG/pmon/P5064

	Directory in which the final PMON executable for Algorithmics
	P5064 board is built.

etc.

$LSIPKG/tools

	Contains the "newversion" shell script, which increments a
	version number on each rebuild.

$LSIPKG/net/sys

	The directories below here reflect the NetBSD.2 kernel
	organisation.  The network and socket code is largely
	unchanged, but the "kernel" has been replaced by a simple
	emulation which runs one "process" at a time to completion.

$LSIPKG/net/sys/R4000
	
	Directory to hold the R4000 version of the network kernel library.

$LSIPKG/net/libc

	Key network related portions of the NetBSD.2 C library.

$LSIPKG/net/libc/R4000

	Directory to hold the R4000 version of the network C library.

$LSIPKG/net/cmd

	Command/Application level network code (e.g. network
	configuration, TFTP file i/o, network bootstrap, ping.
	
$LSIPKG/net/cmd/R4000

	Directory to hold the R4000 version of the network "commands" library.

$LSIPKG/net/include

	Selection of user-level header files from NetBSD.2.


So you can see that to port PMON to a new board "foobar", you need to create 
new directories $LSIPKG/pmon/foobar, containing the board-specific source code
and $LSIPKG/pmon/FOOBAR, which will hold the binaries.  On Windows, which has
case-insensitive file names, this is likely to cause some confusion.  Sorry.
